FizzBuzz is a game about division. Create a program that will iterate through numbers from one to 101 and log each number in the console.In the loop, every time a number is divisible by three, instead of logging the number itself, the word "fizz" should appear.If the number is divisible by five, the word "buzz" should be logged.If the number is divisible by both three and five, then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.
